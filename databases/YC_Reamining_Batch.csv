At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. 

Enter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. 

Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.

To get there, we’re taking a different approach than most. We're applying our technologies to every industry where autonomous electric aircraft can be useful, starting with the highest value and most dangerous jobs. In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems. 

We design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.

Today, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA. 

Our cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments. Both vehicles are highly economical to operate, easy to deploy, and significantly reduce C02 emissions in their respective industries.  

What you work on at Pyka makes people’s lives better now and brings the future of electric aviation one step closer each day.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

PROBLEM:
--------------
• AI teams struggle with LLM accuracy building AI workflows and agents because of messy, conflicting, fragmented internal knowledge.
• Internal knowledge conflicts, uses undefined jargon and rely on unstated company assumptions & context.
• LLMs are like Day 0 fresh hires – they can’t understand this documentation properly without someone explaining context to them.
• Furthermore, vector search suffers from poorer retrieval accuracy when company context and terms are not present in a knowledge article

WHAT WE DO
-------------------
• Clean & De-Conflict: Our AI agents read every doc, resolve contradictions, and builds content relationships.

• Context Distillation: Our AI agents read & compare related docs, distills context and rewrites an LLM-optimised version of your internal documentation. Optional human-approval ensures 100% confidence in the output.

THE OUTCOME
----------------------
• Agents and chatbots that actually understand your enterprise context.
• Retrieval that delivers precise, policy-aligned answers on the first try.

Today we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.

Yet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.

At Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.

Right now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!

We're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀

- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.

We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.


The Problem: 
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).


Our Approach: 
In our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",AI Co-Pilot for Chemical Process Optimization,2.0,B2B,"B2B -> Engineering, Product and Design",2024-05-28 21:27:33,[],False,False,False,Summer 2024,Active,"['B2B', 'Engineering, Product and Design']","['United States of America', 'America / Canada']",Early,False,False,,False

Our previous product - 
Focus buddy is an AI productivity coach that stays on calls with you and help you accomplish your important work goals on a daily basis, even when you are struggling to focus.

We noticed that our users develop a productive relationship with Focus Buddy. Users stay on calls for multiple hours everyday where they depend on Focus Buddy to:
• Avoid procrastination and get started: Address hidden anxieties, embrace imperfection, chunk tasks, kickstart with mini-goals, and use regular check-ins to maintain momentum.
• Recover from distractions and stay focused: Focus Buddy detects when they are working on less important tasks or scrolling on social media, help them overcome the underlying concerns feeding the distraction, and help them get back to the important task
• Manage stress and Prevent Burnout: Focus Buddy detects stress buildup, integrates mindfulness habits to the workflow, helps take short rejuvenating breaks, and stay composed.

Our Initial ICP is people with ADHD who are highly motivated but also highly blocked by internal and environmental factors. In the future, we believe each worker should have their own personal coach that enforces proven productivity techniques in real time to help them extract more focused hours every day with the same effort.

Where is this money coming from?

- Retailers: When the price of clothes or furniture you've already bought drops, you're entitled to a refund for the difference
- Airlines: When a flight you've booked gets delayed or canceled, you're entitled to a cash compensation.
- Enterprises: When a class-action lawsuit is filed against a company you engage with, you're entitled to money.
- And many more, that even the government holds some of your unclaimed funds.

Today, the dream of one service that automatically claims the money you deserve when you shop, fly,... and live is (finally) possible.

We started with automating refunds in the shopping industry and have secured $8,000 in refunds to our users, growing 233% MoM. With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape.

Every year 50% of U.S. truck space goes unused, a $100B+ inefficiency. Oway uses AI to automatically price, match, and sell that space in real time, giving businesses freight shipping that is dramatically faster and cheaper than traditional options. 

We're building the largest decentralized network of America’s empty truck space - a transparent infrastructure layer any shipper, broker, or carrier can plug into. For shippers, this means freight costs that are up to 50% lower than traditional LTL (shipments from 1 to 12 pallets), along with faster delivery windows because freight moves directly from dock to dock without the slow handoffs, warehouses, or cross-docking infrastructure that LTL depends on. For carriers, Oway’s integration can increase annual revenues by up to 30% with minimal impact on existing schedules. They simply earn more by monetizing space that would have gone unused.

Our mission is to transform empty truck space into an asset that strengthens U.S. competitiveness. By lowering the cost of goods sold, we help businesses grow. By improving carrier margins, we make trucking more sustainable. And by digitizing and decentralizing freight, we are laying the foundation for a resilient, transparent logistics layer that can support America’s reindustrialization in the decades ahead.

We’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. 

Under the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like ""trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. 

The founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.

As AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.

For ten thousand years, efficiency meant physical work. Intellectual work rode the surplus. Better farming, manufacturing, transport. But the brain itself bottlenecked every intellectual task.

Compute changes this. For the first time, we can drive efficiency gains in intellectual work directly. Any repeatable job with measurable output has an efficiency ratio. Useful work divided by energy consumed. Intelligence per watt.

Humans perform tasks at some quality-weighted outcomes per kilowatt-hour. AI systems do the same jobs. We can measure both the same way. AI is crossing the human baseline. Domain after domain.

The world's hardest problems are information problems, and human intelligence is no longer the limit. The cost of intelligence per unit of energy is the limit. Every order of magnitude drop in cost expands the set of solvable problems.

Our mission at Wafer is to maximize intelligence per watt by using AI to optimize AI infrastructure, achieving thousands of times better energy and cost efficiency.

The compute bottleneck is the biggest constraint on AI progress. NVIDIA can't manufacture enough GPUs, and their monopoly keeps prices astronomical.

- Building agents? Use granular streams to persist context in real time, make workflows auditable, and coordinate between agents.

- Publishing fast-moving data? Streams support high fanout and can be accessed directly over the internet, so they are a great fit for broadcasting real-time feeds.

⚡Computer Agent logs into existing systems (e.g., ERP, Accounting, other CFO systems)
⚡Automates Finance processes (e.g., pricing, billing, month-end)
⚡Uploads & submits in your system (e.g., create journal entry)

*The Blockers ➜ Your Finance Systems:*
Finance Operations is buried in repetitive tasks, driving:
❌ Lack finance visibility for decision-making
❌ Wasted time by in-house or outsourced teams
❌ Mistakes and delays from human-driven processes

Barriers to FinOps automation have included:
🚨 Legacy ERPs with limited AI
🚨 Authentication-protected websites & portals
🚨 Too many Finance Systems that lack full integrations

It doesn’t have to be this way.

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
*The Breakthrough ➜ Zalos:*

Zalos Agents run your rule-based processes, using your existing Finance applications:
⭐ Our agents automate processes based on simple instructions (e.g., Screen Recording, PDFs)
⭐ Native handling of ERPs or other applications (e.g., 2FA, Captcha)
⭐ Superior performance from our FinOps libraries (e.g., Data Extraction & Harmonization, Reconciliation, etc.)

Customer story:
FROM: In the Bay area, a Finance Manager was wasting 8 days (!) per month:
✖️ Downloads transactions from Corporate Credit Cards & legacy Banks
✖️ Uploads into NetSuite and manually categorizes 100s of transactions

USING ZALOS: Finance Manager schedules ‘run process’ weekly:
✔️ Zalos handles 2FA to download & submit required transactions
✔️ Zalos operates NetSuite to categorize >60% outstanding transactions

*

No browser required: Zalos works silently in the background, whilst continuously improving itself. 

Gaining 2 days per week was transformational. The Finance Manager could
🟪 Reduce financial risks with closer inspection (e.g., debt covenants) 
🟪 Catch cash leakages by spotting suppliers being paid at generous terms
🟪 Be a strategic partner to the CEO & business with better analysis

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
Zalos transforms your Finance Operations:
☑️ Scale without headcount - don’t let Operations teams be a bottleneck
☑️ Smarter every day, with evals & RL-finetuning driving a self-performing system
☑️ Built for Enterprise-grade security and screen records every automation for audit

Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).

At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world.

Coin 2.0 lets you swipe or tap your cards at millions of merchants across the USA. Coin 2.0 has 80%+ compatibility, partly because we use cutting-edge technology that has not yet been integrated into all point-of-sale systems. We encourage customers to carry a “backup card” given the wide variety of sales registers in the USA. While Coin 2.0 shares the same form factor as a credit card, it features enhancements such as an electronic display and a single button to allow for simple switching between different cards. With over-the-air updates, Coin 2.0 adapts to evolving payment technology, offering future-ready ubiquity in a small and powerful package. Coin's security features also keep your information safe. Auto-unlock means that only you can use your Coin 2.0 while Last Known Location helps you find your Coin 2.0 in case of loss or theft. Coin 2.0 is designed for use in the USA.

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.

1444,Bountiful,https://bountiful.ag/,"San Francisco, CA, USA","We’re on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",An Operating System for agriculture.,4.0,Industrials,Industrials -> Agriculture,2016-11-02 02:20:27,"['Machine Learning', 'Marketplace', 'Analytics', 'Agriculture']",False,False,False,Winter 2017,Active,"['Industrials', 'Agriculture']","['United States of America', 'America / Canada', 'Remote', 'Partly Remote']",Early,False,False,,False

Goodcover is a Managing General Agent (MGA) that administers personal insurance on behalf of our Membership, a bit like how USAA does it.

Member's premiums are pooled and used to pay claims.  We take a fixed fee, and the remainder is returned in our Annual Member Dividend.

We work with multi-billion dollar capital partners to ensure regulations are followed, adequate claims capital is always available, and we have emergency capacity for catastrophes.

Technology allows us to eliminate waste, saving roughly 25% of the cost.  We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members.

As an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our ""Marketing Budget"" into savings for Members.  This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.
We do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.

Our granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:
    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor
    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)
    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)
    - added coverage for mold removal

We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year.

Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders – the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure.

Our drug will target mitochondria – the powerhouse of the cell – to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat.

FlowDeploy is built for bioinformaticians: it doesn't restrict how pipelines are built and managed, as long as a bioinformatics workflow manager like Nextflow or Snakemake is used. But it does eliminate several footguns like idle spend and accidental data egress, and it reduces the potential for users accidentally sharing credentials.

FlowDeploy runs the pipelines in either our managed cloud or the customer's cloud – eliminating the need to transfer data externally.

Non-computational biologists can use FlowDeploy, too: features like pipelines templates decrease the complexity to launch a new pipeline, which reduces user error and decreases the need for advanced cloud training for non-computational users.",Bioinformatics pipelines in the cloud,3.0,B2B,B2B -> Infrastructure,2022-01-27 01:38:48,"['Developer Tools', 'Drug discovery', 'Data Engineering']",False,False,False,Winter 2022,Inactive,"['B2B', 'Infrastructure']","['United States of America', 'America / Canada', 'Remote', 'Fully Remote']",Early,False,False,,False

In industries like insurance, where trust and traceability matter more than speed, verified outcomes have become the new competitive edge.

•⁠ ⁠Arabic + English first agents with Gulf dialect understanding. 97+ other languages supported

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

27037,Metriport,https://metriport.com/,"San Francisco, CA, USA","Metriport provides real-time access to comprehensive medical data for 300M+ individuals across the US. Our open-source intelligence platform helps organizations access, analyze, and exchange patient data while integrating with all major healthcare IT systems.

If you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on archaic methods is still the norm: typically, you or your provider need to call the facilities where you’ve previously received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like your active medication list, what conditions you may have, latest lab results, etc. This not only delays care—it can cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical for informing treatment decisions. 

Metriport integrates fragmented medical data from thousands of sources—including both national and state/regional Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), ADTs, EHRs, pharmacies, and labs—through a single API connector. The platform then standardizes, deduplicates, and enriches this data to create a comprehensive longitudinal patient record, with AI-powered clinical summaries. 

Along with a rich understanding of patient health history, healthcare providers also get realtime updates about their patients' health through Metriport. This includes getting notified when a patient is discharged from the hospital, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, or has a new lab result available. Through this data, care teams get insights across their patient population, helping with 30-day readmissions prediction, care gap closure, risk adjustment, and more.

On top of all of this, Metriport enables healthcare organizations to share net-new clinical information back to all major healthcare IT systems, and to become interoperable with popular EHR systems such as Epic, Cerner, athena, eClinicalWorks, and many more—forming an internet for healthcare data.

Metriport improves both patient and provider lives at the point-of-care, supporting use cases such as medication adherence, transitions of care management, chart prep, and much more.

We're fully open source, and provide a unique integrated development & observability experience for those building anything in the AI space. This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.

How? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.

We've got two open source projects:
- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).
- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev

Both Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.

Once connected, these apps behave like any other IdP-managed service: policies like MFA, Conditional Access, RBAC, and audit logging just work, and end users access them through SSO only.

Customers use Aglide to secure both individual apps (e.g., legacy banking portals, Discord, Squarespace) and sensitive shared accounts (e.g., AWS root, social media). Our agentic identity technology means Aglide works with any app out of the box - no integration catalog, no custom scripting.

29074,Fiber AI,https://fiber.ai/,"San Francisco, CA, USA","Fiber AI helps GTM and recruiting teams build surgical TAM lists that AI SDRs/AI BDRs can't create. While AI sales automation tools fail at targeted prospecting, we provide advanced filters (headcount growth tracking, fundraising data, education filters, Google Maps scraping) to build niche audiences for multi-channel outbound (i.e. things like LinkedIn ads, Google ads, Meta ads, cold email, cold calling, invites to Luma events, and other outbound). Our 16+ provider waterfalls deliver high quality emails and phone numbers, and we offer a 0% email bounce guarantee, making this a risk-free offer for customers (something that Apollo.io, Clay.com, Hunter.io, People Data Labs, LeadMagic, Prospeo, FindyMail, Wiza, Icypeas, FullEnrich, Datagma, Dropcontact, and others can't and won't ever offer).

The problem with AI sales copilots and AI sales automation is that they can't build targeted lists. Success in modern sales requires niche, surgical targeting - then executing personalized outbound across multiple channels. That's where Fiber AI excels.

Our platform consists of 3 core components:

First, building precise lists that AI SDRs can't match (replaces broad AI BDR spraying, unfocused AI sales automation, and lead generation software). We are able to filter on things like:

1) Headcount Growth Tracking: Find scaling companies with monthly, quarterly, yearly employee growth metrics
2) Deep Filtering: Fundraising history, Ivy League alumni search, promotion patterns, office expansions
3) Intent Signals: Open jobs data, hiring patterns, technographic filters, company metadata search
4) Custom Searches: Education filters (""MIT grads excluding summer programs""), bio keyword search, LinkedIn profile headlines
5) Google Maps Intelligence: Local business scraping with radius search, rating filters, geofencing
Multi-Channel Export: Build lists optimized for LinkedIn ads, Google ads, Meta ads, cold calling scripts, email sequences, or Luma event invites

We are the best TAM builder (TAM list builder) to help you find your ICP (build an ICP list). This precision targeting is why top SDRs and recruiters use us instead of generic AI SDR or AI recruiting tools (for cold outreach).

Second, email deliverability requires rigorous validation of data. Our 0% Bounce Guarantee is something that no other vendors offer, and we are able to offer this because we have invested in a rigorous infrastructure that will clean and validate emails and phone numbers. While tools like Smartlead, Instantly, Lemlist, and Reply.io help you send emails, they can't prevent bounces that destroy your domain reputation. Our edge comes from:

1) Using 16+ Validator Waterfall: Unlike Clay.com (which only checks the first source in an email waterfall or phone waterfall) or basic tools like ZeroBounce, DeBounce, NeverBounce, or EmailListVerify, we run every contact through ALL validators
2) True Email Bounce Detection: Our contact waterfalls includes email grabbers, email and phone databases, email validators, bounce detectors, and phone verification services
3) Phone Validation Too: Similar waterfall for phone numbers - direct dial verification, mobile validation
4) Industry-Specific Waterfalls: We change the vendors we use in our waterfalls depending on the industry of contacts that we are fetching, leading to more accurate contact data
5) 0% bounce promise. If an email bounces, DM us for instant refund. No forms, no fuss.

Apollo.io (Apollo email, Apollo phones, Apollo contact), Hunter.io (Hunter), Dropcontact.com (Dropcontact), Wiza.com (Wiza), ContactOut, Lusha all cannot offer this 0% email bounce guarantee because their data quality is inconsistent and poor, and doing so would make them bleed money. We can, because our process is highly sophisticated and customers get <1% bounce rates on average (which we refund the credits for due to our 0% email bounce guarantee) 

Third, we use AI Agents for data extraction from unconventional data sources like:

1) Conference attendee lists for targeted event follow-up
2) Google Maps data for local business outreach
3) Custom company research for personalized messaging
4) Competitor customer identification for strategic targeting
5) LinkedIn Sales Navigator scrapes that allow us to get companies from LinkedIn sales nav, followers of a company, and more (i.e. LinkedIn scraper, Sales Navigator export, LinkedIn export, LinkedIn data export)

This allows us to find precise leads that are not present in traditional contact databases, and specialize to different use cases and verticals. 

We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts (i.e. B2B database), sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM like Clearbit, 6sense, Demandbase), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.

This is why RevOps, sales, growth, recruiting, and outbound teams choose us over AI SDR platforms (artisan ai, 11x, amplemarket, reply.io, unify gtm, penguin ai, regie ai, aisdr, artisan sdr, outreach io, and warmly ai), existing lead databases (email enrichment, bulk email finder, or phone enrichment tools like apollo, zoominfo, leadIQ), and contact enrichment tools (clay, persana ai) that promise automation and enrichment but deliver poor results.

Users who deepen bonds with these AI character friends can invite them out with them to Discord, Minecraft or even a Netflix-n-chill session.

Our Character engine, ego AI, built on top of Unreal, will allow users to create, deploy and even monetize their characters across any surface that supports our CCProtocol. The first use case for our characters will likely be DnD-style roleplay, Minecraft RP, and Twitch streaming. 

Characters will always live and exist in Simtowns with other AIs (and humans) where they will all lead varied internal lives replete with conflict, danger, opportunity, and love…just like humans in the real world!

During YC, we used our engine to build TownWorld - a 3D interactive Twitch live stream of the Stanford generative agents paper (https://www.twitch.tv/townworld). To the best of our knowledge, it's the first ever AI 3D simulation of a small town in real time

You can use cmux like Jira, Asana, or GitHub Issues, writing a bunch of tickets like a todos list – except cmux will deploy AI coding agents of your choice to complete the tickets for you. 

For every task that you start, cmux will:
- Start up dev environments that include VS Code + browser previews for any dev servers so you can visually verify and test live changes fast
- Spin up cloud sandboxes to safely deploy AI coding agents in YOLO mode so they can move fast and NOT break things
- Evaluate all of the code diffs for all of your selected AI coding agents when they finish their tasks and choose the best version for you

The future of software engineering will be managing, verifying, and reviewing 10+ coding tasks done by AI agents simultaneously.

Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. 

Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can’t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.

We're transforming how Medicare agencies handle member relationships with teams of voice AI agents. We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.

Our multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.

We've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration.

- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates
- 37% improvement in 90-day retention
- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP
- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024

James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies.

We began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as “Wave”, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. 

We have since released ""Reach"", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.

We’re not a generic annotation vendor—we’re your on-demand evaluation and safety data engine. In under a minute, you can spin up your own data-annotation workspace tailored to your workflow, so your team can move from “we think it works” to measurable, repeatable results. 

Modern AI changes quickly. Models evolve, prompts shift, and new edge cases appear the moment you go live. Besimple is built for that reality. Our platform generates task-specific annotation experiences aligned to your data and goals, so you can capture reliable judgment on everything from factuality and safety to preference and policy compliance. The result is an always-current evaluation loop that keeps pace with your product, rather than a one-off test that goes stale. 

We specialize in evaluation and expert-grade safety data—not commodity labeling. That means we recruit and train domain experts and SMEs to judge model outputs against high bars, and we design the interfaces and guidelines to make those judgments consistent, auditable, and useful for both offline evals and production monitoring. 

Your team shouldn’t be waiting on back-and-forth specs and custom tooling. With Besimple, you can paste or stream your data, click to generate a tailored interface, and start collecting ground truth right away. When the task changes, the UI adapts with it. 

We combine pragmatic product design with a human-in-the-loop operating model. Besimple helps you create clear, actionable guidelines and then enforces them with workflow guardrails, reviewer consensus, and targeted spot-checks—so you can trust the numbers you ship. Because we’re built for iterative work, teams can quickly compare prompts, models, and policies; spot regressions; and push fixes backed by fresh, expert-reviewed data. 

Great models don’t happen by accident—they’re the product of tight feedback loops, expert judgment, and tooling that bends to your data, not the other way around. If you’re ready to replace slow, one-size-fits-all processes with a purpose-built evaluation and safety engine, Besimple gives you the fastest path from raw data to reliable decisions—so you can iterate boldly and ship with confidence.",Expert-in-the-loop eval data for AI,2.0,B2B,B2B,2025-05-21 21:10:43,"['AIOps', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Labeling']",False,True,False,Spring 2025,Active,['B2B'],"['United States of America', 'America / Canada']",Early,False,False,,False

We launched mid July, and our agent is already operating in production environments, creating appointments in electronic health record apps and processing files in legacy ERPs.

We’ve built the first computer use agent that memorizes tasks and repeats them quickly while still adapting to unexpected changes on the screen. A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.

Mahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group.

F4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.

F4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions.

It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.

We’re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant — the employee they’ll never fire.

We started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family’s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.

Until now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.

More importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!

Our customers say it best:

- “Certus changed my life overnight.”
- “We were losing the ability to give great in-house service — the phone was killing us.”
-  “70% of my business comes through the phone. That’s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.”
- “Before Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day…. now my printer just stays printing!”
-  “I’ve been in the business 38 years. I’ve been waiting for this since then.”

Certus is here to fix the $120B phone problem — one call at a time.

And in doing so, we’re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",Replacing the restaurant phone line with Voice AI,3.0,B2B,B2B,2025-07-21 22:07:42,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'Restaurant Tech', 'AI']",False,False,False,Summer 2025,Active,['B2B'],"['United States of America', 'America / Canada']",Early,False,False,,False

Modelence is a batteries-included framework that abstracts away boilerplate so you can just focus on building your product logic and nothing else - it’s like Next.js + Vercel + Supabase on a single platform, built for full-stack TypeScript.

Shipping production apps is much harder than building a prototype that runs locally and 95% of all production apps share the same building blocks. We did a massive amount of work on our previous platforms that was not specific to our product, and we’ve created Modelence to abstract that away:

Every year, trillions of dollars in venture, real-estate, and private-equity capital are deployed through diligence processes that haven’t changed in decades. Analysts spend hours parsing PDFs and spreadsheets just to understand what a company or property is worth.

Alt-X is building the data and AI infrastructure layer for alternative assets — a system that ingests unstructured deal materials, normalizes the data, and generates institutional-grade analysis in seconds. Whether it’s a private-company dataroom or a real-estate offering memorandum, Alt-X extracts key KPIs like ARR, growth, NOI, IRR, and cap rate, then produces investor-ready dashboards and reports automatically.

Our platform reduces deal evaluation timelines by up to 73%, saves 30–50 analyst hours per deal, and enables teams to screen 4× more opportunities with the same headcount. By automating KPI extraction, benchmarking, and underwriting, Alt-X transforms diligence from a manual bottleneck into a scalable process.

This hasn’t been done at scale because private-market data is fragmented across formats and asset classes. Alt-X’s parsing engine unifies this chaos into a structured schema — the backbone for cross-asset underwriting, KPI dashboards, and automated risk scoring.

Our first wedge is real estate and private equity, where underwriting is slowest and most manual. We’re already piloting with family offices and private funds managing over $200 million in assets, paying $1K–$5K per month to automate deal screening and valuation.
